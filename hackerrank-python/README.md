# 📘 HackerRank Python Track – Complete Practice

This folder contains my complete solution set for the [HackerRank Python track](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-python), organized by official topics and problem categories.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

As part of building my foundations in Python and preparing for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), I've solved **all key problems** in HackerRank’s Python domains. This also supports my long-term goals of:

- Mastering Python for AI/ML
- Building a strong coding portfolio
- Transitioning to LeetCode and real-world projects
